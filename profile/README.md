joe sim is a online game made in [üêßpenguinmod!](https://github.com/PenguinMod) and also rereleased elsewhere. those include:
1. [‚ö°electramod](https://github.com/ElectraMod)
2. *uhh thats kinda it for now lol*

this has archives of most of the joe games!
why most? 
because my usb filled with all versions got corruped. damn.
but there are only few versions that i don't fave, so when penguinmod servers come back online, they will be reposted.

and for now (*and probably forever*) it's only me working on joe simulator, so yeah. here are some links:
